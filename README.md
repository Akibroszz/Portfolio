# Yenti Verle (Akibroszz) Portfolio

This is my portfolio created using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). I'm a huge advocate of Free and Open Source so I wanted to post this to my GitHub.
Please excuse my messy code, I'm not a programmer and definitely not a web developer, it's also my first Next.js project.

I hope somebody can use this code to get inspired to make their own website, again do keep in mind that this code is probably horribly optimised.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.
The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More About Next.js

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Credits

I want to give a big shout-out to the creators of the [Nord theme](https://www.nordtheme.com/) and the creators of the [Dracula theme](https://draculatheme.com/), these are basically the only 2 themes I use anymore and the website is also designed using these.

Soteria is a prototype I made for learning more about PKI management.
During my internship I got interested in PKI management and wanted to see how these tools work, thus creating this project.
Currently, not a lot of features are implemented, as of now you can generate a self-signed certificate and a CSR trough the tool, helper functions are prepared for more, but I haven't had the free time to continue working on this project.
